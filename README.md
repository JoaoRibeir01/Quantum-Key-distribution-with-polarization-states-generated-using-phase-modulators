# QuantumStates
I would like to acknowledge the Instituto de Telecomunicações and the project UIDB/50008/2020-UIDP/50008/2020 (action QuRunner), founded in part by FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU funds.
In this project we analyzed the quantum key distribution process, considering that information was codified in discrete variables using states of polarization from a attenuated laser emitting light at 1.55 μm. The states of polarization were generated using eletro-optical phase modulators.
A theoretical and numerical detailed description about generating states of polarization using phase modulators was made. Furthermore, the process of random basis choice at receiver is also studied considering that Bob uses
a phase modulator and a polarization beam-splitter. As well, we observed how phase modulators can be used as devices that allow to choose random basis. Besides that, in this project the impact of the random variations
of the quantum states during its propagation in standard optical fibers is also studied. To do so, a laboratorial setup was implemented to test the generation of the quantum states associated to the BB84 protocol. After
this process, conclusions were taken about the transmission process, being evaluated the quantum error associated to the generation, transmission and detection of the quantum states, essential in this quantum protocol, to
analyse possible eavesdropper attacks.
